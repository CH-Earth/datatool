## Coordinate Variables and Time-stamps

### Coordinate Variables
The coordinate variables of the `CaSRv3.1` simulations are
`lon` and `lat` representing the longitude and latitude data, respectively.
### Time-stamps
The time-stamps are included in the original files.

## Dataset Variables
The NetCDF files of the dataset contain 38 variables. You may see a list
of variables by using the `ncdump -h`  command on one of the files:
```console
foo@bar:~$ ncdump -h /path/to/dataset/files/casrv3.1/2018010112.nc
```

## Spatial Extent
The spatial extent of the `CaSR` v3.1 is on latitutes from `+7.75`
to `+84.75` and longitudes from `-179.9925` to `179.9728` covering
North America. The resolution is 0.09 degrees (~10km). 

## Temporal Extent
The time-steps are hourly covering from `January 1980` to `December 2023`.

## Short Description on `CaSR` v3.1 Variables
In most hydrological modelling applications, usually 7 variables are needed
detailed as following: 1) specific humidity, 2) surface pressure,
3) air temperature, 4) wind speed, 5) precipitation (surface level),
6) downward short wave radiation (surface level), and 7) downward
long wave radiation (surface level). These variables are available through
`CaSR` v3.1 dataset and their details are described in the table below:
